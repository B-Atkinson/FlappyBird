# FlappyBird
Agents are trained using human logic and reinforcement learning to play FlappyBird. 

flappy_main_OLD.py is from CS3315 where the same environment was used in a group project, that file is kept just so I can recall how to instantiate the environment. 

The ple package is a customized version of pygames learning environment, which was sourced through GitHub. 

Training in Hamming is instantiated using the human.sh and no_human.sh shell scripts which launch the same code but with varying human influence.
